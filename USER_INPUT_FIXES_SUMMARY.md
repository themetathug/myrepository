# 🎯 MAPSHOCK User Input Flow Fixes - COMPLETE ✅

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

Your MAPSHOCK workflow now properly handles user input throughout the entire pipeline, **just like ChatGPT**!

### **❌ What Was Wrong:**
- Hardcoded test queries in Context Agent (`"LAM Research wants strategic guidance..."`)
- Hardcoded examples in Protocol Selector (`"Analyze cybersecurity threats..."`)
- Test functions using fixed company names instead of user input
- Mock data using static examples instead of dynamic user context

### **✅ What Was Fixed:**

## 1. **Context Agent** (`mapshock-MVP/backend/agents/context_agent.py`)

**Before:**
```python
# HARDCODED ❌
test_input = "LAM Research wants strategic guidance on if it should invest $1B in India or Korea for it's Chip Fab capex investments strategy"
result = await agent.analyze(test_input)
```

**After:**
```python
# USER INPUT DRIVEN ✅
async def test_context_agent(user_query: str = None):
    if not user_query:
        user_query = input("Enter your analysis query: ").strip()
        if not user_query:
            user_query = "Analyze competitive landscape and strategic options for semiconductor equipment market"
    
    result = await agent.analyze(user_query)  # Uses actual user input
```

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ All test functions now accept `user_query` parameter
- ✅ Interactive input prompts for testing
- ✅ Fallback to generic examples (not specific companies)
- ✅ Production workflow uses `user_input` parameter exclusively

## 2. **Protocol Selector** (`mapshock-MVP/backend/agents/protocol_selector_agent_v38.py`)

**Before:**
```python
# HARDCODED ❌
user_query = "Analyze cybersecurity threats to our financial infrastructure and recommend defensive strategies"
mock_context = {
    "original_query": "Analyze cybersecurity threats to critical infrastructure",
    "companies": ["Tesla", "Microsoft"],  # HARDCODED
}
```

**After:**
```python
# USER INPUT DRIVEN ✅
async def test_protocol_selector(test_query: str = None):
    if not test_query:
        test_query = input("Enter query for testing (or press Enter for default): ").strip()
        if not test_query:
            test_query = "Analyze security threats to critical infrastructure"
    
    # Dynamic entity extraction based on user query
    companies = []
    industries = []
    query_lower = test_query.lower()
    
    if "technology" in query_lower:
        industries.append("technology")
    # ... dynamic extraction logic
    
    mock_context = {
        "original_query": test_query,  # USER INPUT
        "extracted_entities": {
            "companies": companies,     # EXTRACTED FROM USER INPUT
            "industries": industries    # EXTRACTED FROM USER INPUT
        }
    }
```

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Dynamic mock context generation based on user input
- ✅ Entity extraction from user queries
- ✅ Analysis type determination from user context
- ✅ No hardcoded company names or scenarios

---

## 3. **Research Agent** (`mapshock-MVP/backend/agents/research_agent.py`)

**Already Correct! ✅**
The Research Agent was already properly designed:
- ✅ Receives context from Protocol Selector
- ✅ Extracts company/industry from user-provided context
- ✅ Generates LLM queries based on user input
- ✅ No hardcoded data in production workflow

**LLM Query Generation:**
```python
# USER CONTEXT DRIVEN ✅
queries.append(ResearchQuery(
    query_type="primary_analysis",
    query_text=f"Conduct {context['analysis_type']} analysis for {context['company']} in the {context['industry']} industry. Focus on: {context['original_query']}",
    priority="high"
))
```

---

## 4. **Main Application** (`mapshock-MVP/main.py`)

**Already Correct! ✅**
The main application properly handles user input:
- ✅ `UserInput` model accepts user queries
- ✅ `build_orchestration_query()` constructs query from user data
- ✅ No hardcoded inputs in production workflow
- ✅ WebSocket support for real-time user interactions

## 🔄 Complete Workflow Verification

### **User Input Flow:**
```
📤 User Query: "Analyze Tesla's competitive position in EV market"
    ↓
🔍 Context Agent: Extracts entities → ["Tesla"], ["automotive"], analysis_type="competitive"
    ↓  
🛡️ Protocol Selector: Selects protocols based on competitive analysis + Tesla context
    ↓
🧠 Research Agent: Generates LLM queries about Tesla's competitive position
    ↓
🤖 LLM: Analyzes Tesla specifically in EV market (from user context)
    ↓
🧠 Research Agent: Synthesizes Tesla-specific responses
    ↓
📊 User Interface: Returns analysis of Tesla's competitive position
```

### **Verification Results:**
```
🎯 VERIFICATION SUMMARY
✅ User input properly flows through entire workflow
